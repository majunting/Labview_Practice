hey dr. Bovik,

here is a link to my ftp page where you can download the demos.  the files are 
called "1.zip" which has all the vi's and "pics.zip" which has all the images.

http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~baumgart/1.zip
http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~baumgart/pics.zip

just put both the exaracted folders in the same directory.
i use the images in the folder My Pictures>>motion images>>*.*
-the translation images are identical, except translated(lena1-->lena2).

optical flow:
-pretty strait forward.  uses the discrete approximation(of the H&S method?)
-use the images in any of the folders ball, mobile, mobile_full, or translation

motion estimation:
-also pretty strait forward.
-optional block size of 8x8 and 16x16.
-all match methods work with brute force search procedure, but 3-step only 
works with MSE and MAD so far.
-subsampling and pre-smoothing must be selected before opening the images.
-check out the 'mobile' frames.  they work best.
-motion estimation and reconstruction ignores the borders(copies them).

differencing:
-just hit the buttons.  the wrong order shouldn't cause any problems.
-toggle the 'use MC?' switch to use motion compensated differencing.
-after differencing you can play with the threshold slide to eliminate low 
value differences.
-everything is done in 16 bit signed format instead of 8bit, so in the 
difference image(3rd on top) black = large negative values and white = large 
positive values.  the predominant gray color is zero or near zero.
-clicking 'Noise' adds noise to the difference image(transmitted image).
-max value is the max gray level in the difference image.
-#values = # of different gray levels including negatives from the differencing.
-max and # values are kinda screwy right now, but will be used to determine bit 
depth from a huffman code.
-reconstruct with and without noise or with MC and without MC shows differences 
in max gray level and #values(although there may be some bugs right now).
-1st image on bottom is a binary threshold mask.
-2nd on bottom is the difference with the mask applied.
-3rd on bottom is the reconstructed image w/wo MC.

img_convert:
-just open an image, select the noise type, compression type, value, and save.
-ouput displays original file size and new file size as well as new image.
-let me know about bugs that occur from hitting buttons, saving, opening, 
executing in different orders.
-it saves as a default to a dummy file 'new_img.*'.  you might have to erase 
this file if it keeps opening the same image.  i'll fix that eventualy.

frame rate:
-not useful.


that's all for now.  please give me every good and bad thought you concoct.  
especially if they are unclear, cluttered, over complicated...  i still want to 
improve a lot on these, as well as make some new ones.  wavelets?  i also want 
to incorporate live video into all of them which shouldn't be too tough, using 
your firewire card.

happy holidays!

frank
